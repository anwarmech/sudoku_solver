Sudoku Puzzle Solver with Dynamic GUI Validation

The Sudoku Solver project is a Python application with a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input and solve Sudoku puzzles. 

It validates inputs in real-time, ensuring no duplicates in rows, columns, and 3x3 grids, and that all numbers are between 1 and 9. 

Upon valid input, the program solves the puzzle and displays the solution, while invalid inputs trigger an error message. 

Users can solve additional puzzles or exit the application through intuitive buttons.
